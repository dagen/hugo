## Summary
25 years of combined experience in software development, data center operations, and engineering management. Strong advocate of agile, devops, and cloud. Passionate about organizational culture, reducing cycle-time, and mentoring junior engineers.

### Development
I've worked directly and indirectly with software development teams of all skils and across multiple languages (Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby).  I understand the relationships between customers, product ownership, product development, operations, security, sales, and executive leadership.  I firmly believe that companies must go through the journey of an agile transformation, and that this journey is not something that can be done quickly.  This journey involves getting teams to understand the importance of test driven development, test automation, continuous integration, and ultimately contious delivery/deployment.  Once teams reach this level of maturity, all stakeholders benefit.
