I've decided to start blogging again.  This time, I decided to eschew WordPress and go with something a little more lightweight.  Henceforth, this blog will be powered by Hugo.

### Hugo
Hugo is a static-site generator.  Basically, you create your posts using markdown syntax and Hugo will generate static HTMl pages from your diretory of markdown templates.

Hugo is powered by golang, so this is the first time I've used go in any project.  Fortunately, I only have to run go on my local laptop as the server doesn't need anything more than an HTTP server.
